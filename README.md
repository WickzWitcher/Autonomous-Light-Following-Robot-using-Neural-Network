# Autonomous-Light-Following-Robot-using-Neural-Network
This project combines a subsumption-based reactive architecture with a neural network cognitive layer to enable smoother behavior switching, adaptive speed control, and intelligent battery management in Webots.   A great learning experience in behavioral robotics, AI integration, and autonomous decision-making.
